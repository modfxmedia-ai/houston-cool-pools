Rock Waterfalls can add a wonderful natural visual element to your backyard oasis! A truly unique addition to your pool — a Grotto! Grottos can incorporate a waterfall. They can range from simple seats to hidden pools and gathering areas. Sometimes instead of a waterfall (or in addition to it) the top of a grotto can incorporate another water feature such as a slide.",
