  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to build a pool?",
    a: "From contract to swim, most projects take 10 to 14 weeks. Permitting, weather, and add-ons like outdoor kitchens or fire features can shift the timeline. We give you a realistic schedule up front and update you at every phase.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the free in-home quote?",
    a: "A Houston Cool Pools designer comes to your backyard, listens to how you'll actually use the space, and walks you through pool styles, finishes, and add-ons. You leave with a custom design concept, transparent pricing, and zero pressure to decide on the spot.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer financing?",
    a: "Yes. We work with several pool-financing partners offering competitive rates and flexible terms - including no-equity soft-credit-check options. We can connect you with a lender during your quote so you have real monthly numbers alongside your design.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the 100% on-budget guarantee?",
    a: "Once your quote is signed, your price is locked. No surprise change orders, no inflated allowances. The number on your contract is the number you pay - in writing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What areas of Houston do you serve?",
    a: "All of Greater Houston, including Spring, Cypress, Tomball, The Woodlands, Katy, Sugar Land, Pearland, Kingwood, The Heights, and Memorial. Our showroom is in Northwest Houston on Highway 249.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build during fall and winter?",
    a: "Absolutely. Houston's mild winters are one of the best times to build - you'll be swimming the moment summer hits. We build year-round with the same craftsmanship and timeline.",
